# Cervix type classification
In this project, I developed logistic regression and convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify women cervix types based on cervical images provided by Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/intel-mobileodt-cervical-cancer-screening/data). <br />

Cervical image analysis_preprocessing-github.ipynb<br /> 
This notebook displays the preprocessing detail of cervical images, such as image segmentation and image resize.
<br /> 
Cervical image analysis_Logistic modeling.ipynb<br /> 
This notebook shows that the cervix images are classified by a simple logistic regression model with several methods of feature extraction, such as Haralick texture features, Surf, Principal Component Analysis, local directional pattern, and Color histogram.
