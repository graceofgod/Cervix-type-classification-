# Cervix type classification
In this project, I developed Machine Learning algorithms to classify women cervix types based on cervical images provided by Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/intel-mobileodt-cervical-cancer-screening/data). I attempted to achieve best results by implementing and evaluating two classifiers. One is to use logistic regression to classify images with different image feature extraction techniques. The second approach is to use convolutional neural network (CNN), which shows incredibly better performance than logistic regression model. <br />

This notebook displays the preprocessing detail of cervical images, such as image segmentation and image resize.<br />

Cervical image analysis_Logistic modeling.ipynb<br /> 
This notebook shows that the cervix images are classified by a simple logistic regression model with several methods of feature extraction, such as Haralick texture features, Surf, Principal Component Analysis, local directional pattern, and Color histogram.
